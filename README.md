# github.com/richardjypark/dotfiles

Richard Park's dotfiles, managed with [`chezmoi`](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi).

Install them with:

    sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://git.io/chezmoi)" -- -b $HOME/.local/bin
    chezmoi init richardjypark
    chezmoi update
    exec zsh

## Performance Optimizations

This dotfiles setup features a highly optimized `chezmoi` experience, ensuring that `chezmoi apply` and `chezmoi update` operations are exceptionally fast after the initial setup. Key improvements include:

- **Drastic Speed Increase**: Subsequent runs are **~95% faster** (e.g., from 1-2 minutes down to <3 seconds).
- **Quiet by Default**: Console output is minimized to only essential messages (errors, critical operations), eliminating I/O bottlenecks.
- **Smart Script Execution**: Scripts use early exit conditions and state tracking (`~/.cache/chezmoi-state`) to avoid redundant work.
- **Efficient Network Usage**: Package installations (npm, apt-get) and git operations are optimized and their output is suppressed in quiet mode.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Enhanced detection for package managers (apt-get, brew) and robust error handling.

**Core Optimization Techniques:**

1.  **Early Exit Conditions**: All setup scripts first check if their intended operations (e.g., package installation, directory creation) are already completed. If so, they exit immediately.
2.  **Console Output Management**: A `VERBOSE` environment variable controls output. By default, scripts are quiet. Set `VERBOSE=true` for detailed logs.
3.  **State Tracking**: A simple file-based system in `~/.cache/chezmoi-state` remembers completed setup tasks, preventing re-runs.

### Verbose Mode for Debugging

While scripts are quiet by default for speed, you can enable detailed logging for debugging or to see all operations:

```bash
# Enable verbose output for the current session
export VERBOSE=true
chezmoi apply

# Enable for a single command
VERBOSE=true chezmoi apply

# Create a convenient alias (optional, add to your .zshrc or .bashrc)
alias chezmoi-verbose='VERBOSE=true chezmoi'
chezmoi-verbose apply
```

For a comprehensive technical breakdown of all optimizations, see the `PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATIONS.md` file.

## Tmux Configuration

This dotfiles repository includes a tmux configuration with:

- Auto-start tmux when opening a terminal
- Session persistence with tmux-resurrect and tmux-continuum
- Vi mode keybindings
- Mouse support
- Custom key bindings for easier navigation

### Key Bindings

| Shortcut          | Action                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| Alt + h/j/k/l     | Navigate between panes    |
| Prefix + \|       | Split window vertically   |
| Prefix + -        | Split window horizontally |
| Prefix + Ctrl + s | Save session manually     |
| Prefix + Ctrl + r | Restore session manually  |

The default prefix key is `Ctrl + b`.

### Session Management

Sessions are automatically saved every 15 minutes and restored when tmux starts.

## Installed Tools

This dotfiles configuration includes the following tools:

- **Shell**: Zsh with Oh My Zsh
- **Terminal Multiplexer**: Tmux with TPM (Tmux Plugin Manager)
- **Tmux Plugins**:
  - tmux-resurrect (session saving)
  - tmux-continuum (automatic session management)
- **Theme**: Agnoster
- **Zsh Plugins**:
  - zsh-syntax-highlighting
  - zsh-autosuggestions
  - fzf (fuzzy finder)
  - git
  - ssh-agent
  - terraform
- **Node.js Environment**:
  - nvm (Node Version Manager)
- **Terminal**: Ghostty

## Applying Changes and Testing Plugins

To apply changes made to your dotfiles (such as adding the `terraform` Oh My Zsh plugin) and test them, follow these steps:

1. **Apply the Change with chezmoi**

   Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```sh
   chezmoi apply
   ```

   This updates your real dotfiles (like `~/.zshrc`) with the latest changes from your chezmoi-managed templates.

2. **Reload Your Zsh Configuration**

   After applying, reload your shell configuration to activate the new plugin without restarting your terminal:

   ```sh
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

3. **Test the Terraform Plugin**

   - Type `terraform` and press Tab twice. You should see Terraform command completions.
   - You can also check if the plugin is loaded by running:

     ```sh
     echo $plugins
     ```

     You should see `terraform` listed among the plugins.
